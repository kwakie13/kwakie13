# Hi there üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I'm **Piotr**, I am a **Computer Science graduate** and currently, I am trying to get my first **job as a developer**. While studying at Adam Mickiewicz University, my most significant experience was gained in programming with **Python**. 

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge - also in **Python** - while studying in the field of **Data Analysis**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills and experience

You can check out my best work and experience in the repositories below! ‚¨áÔ∏è

* **[planimbly](https://github.com/planimbly/planimbly)** - team project for the completion of bachelor studies in which we created a complex tool for generating schedules for workplaces operating in a shift system. I mainly worked in the field of developing an algorithm for generating schedule.

* **[smiecioInator](https://github.com/kwakie13/smiecioInator)** - my biggest individual project which involved creating an AI-assisted garbage collector. In the project, I used a neural network, genetic algorithm, decision tree, and the A* algorithm.

* **[InteriaGenerator](https://github.com/kwakie13/InteriaGenerator)** - simple yet highly useful project: a speedway match program generator, facilitating the work of journalists at Interia - the third-largest Polish sports portal. Provide team line-ups and get a txt file with the appropriate race line-ups.

* **[NLP solutions](https://github.com/kwakie13/NLP-solutions)** - it's not a project but solutions to assignments from - I think - one of the best classes I participated in while studying Computer Science. I had a chance to have my first experience with popular ML/NLP libraries such as spaCy, Vowpal Wabbit and scikit-learn.
